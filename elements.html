          <h3>About SBS Sahyog</h3>
							
          <p>The aftermath of the ‘Himalayan Tsunami’, the 2013 Uttarakhand natural disaster/floods are
commonly referred to as, attracted numerous fund-raisers across the country that aimed at
making large-scale donations for the purpose of livelihood generation, relief &amp; rehabilitation.
Sahyog too started out as a fundraising drive to donate collections to one or more NGOs working
in the area. School explored possibilities with several NGOs. But the destiny of Sahyog was
meant to take it on a very different route. An idea of notionally adopting a village or two to do
direct interventions with a long-term vision of creating a model of experiential learning that can
be adopted by others was muted by a SBS parent volunteer. After quite a few deliberations SBS
decided to walk that path and even solicited help from an established university. But eventually it
was the ‘can do’ and ‘can learn’ spirit of the Core Team along with the management committee
that paved the way to a rather unique program, which has now turned into a Student Leadership
Development Program through community initiatives. </p>

<h3>Not 'Charity'</h3>
<p>
The core of Sahyog initiative lies in its emphasis on a symbiotic give and take relationship
between students and the villagers who align with this vision with an objective to create an
independent, self-sustaining, and progressive environment in the villages. Sahyog does not
believe in making donations out of philanthropic intentions and instead, aims to inculcate and
build upon a learning process rooted in the concepts of honor and work-is- worship that benefits
the village community at large as well as students and other associates.
</p>
<h3>The Objective</h3>
							
							<p>The objective of SBS Sahyog is to help develop Duggada-Kinsu (and eventually surrounding villages) into “Model

village(s)” areas In partnership with the village residents, local authorities and our project partners. The team is doing

focused and sustained efforts in four key areas:<br>

• Livelihoods/economic activities (Diary Project Initiative)<br>

• Reforestation and disaster preparedness &amp; management<br>

• Healthcare, sanitation &amp; hygiene<br>

• Education<br></p>

<blockquote>"It's amazing how a combination of six letters can mean the world and back to everybody who is associated with this journey." - Diya Ahuja</blockquote>
<h3>Our Approach</h3>


							
							<p>
<ul>
<li>The program is now turning into large student led with the core team streamlining student
efforts and providing necessary guidance and advice.</li>
<li>Each year Sahyog takes 3-4 student trips and for various planning and problem solving purposes many other trips are undertaken by members of the Core Team </li>
<li>The task at hand begins long before the trip. A team of students, teachers and parent volunteers is identified months in advance of every trip. Students brainstorm on the various initiatives that they will carry out during each trip. They carry out research and formulate a work plan that they wish to implement.</li>
<li>During the trip, the ideas are executed in the villages. It is important to understand that real lives are affected by the implementation of these plans and therefore often require modification as and when the situation requires. Sahyog teams stay in tents right next to a mountain stream. Since Duggada and Kinsu are at different altitudes, all trips require a fair bit of mountainous hiking.</li>
<li>At each stage, the core team provides the student participants with valuable feedback that helps them improve their work. On their return, the students are required to write an overall reflection of their trip.</li>
<li>The work done and goals achieved by each stream, along with suggestions for the next trip, are organized and documented in files.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h3>The Sahyog Way</h3>
<p>

<b>Planning: </b>Sahyog's long term continuity is constituted of it's unit elements - the 
individual Sahyog trips. Each trip employs Sahyog's ever evolving planning process:<br>

1. Team Selection: The core team first selects a trip leader, who will lead the trip. The trip
leader selects a team by going through lists of admitted applicants and speaks to the tentative 
travelers, checking their availability and stream preference.<br>

2. The trip lead selects the four stream leads, who meet their teams and begin the planning
process, often conducting meetings over ten times in the 2 months leading up to the trip.<br>
<br>


<b>Mentoring:</b> Mentoring is woven into the Sahyog culture. Experienced participants are assigned 
mentees, who they guide through the Sahyog journey.<br>
<br>


<b>Reflections:</b> Reflections are essential to Sahyog's experiential learning aspect, and to Sahyog's
principles by extension. Students write reflections at the end of every day, and we conduct daily 
debrief and reflection sessions of profound depth, often lasting several hours.

									<h3>Dairy (Livelihood)</h3>
									<p>The Dairy Initiative has been a major focus of Sahyog since its conception. While Sahyog provided the idea, seed capital and a way forward for the villagers, sustained efforts of the participating families  form the basis for this different kind of entrepreneurial initiative with a community-based model. Members of the dairy stream deal with dairy as a socio-economic activity that impacts the livelihood of the villagers in various ways. While the stream is vast and has multiple aspects to it, the focus is mainly on the well-being of the cows, their productivity, and the involvement of the villagers in all dairy related activities. Past activities included construction of community cowsheds, following ups and repairs/painting of cowsheds, creation and distribution of fodder and milk production logs, analysis of profit and loss with regard to dairy, deep dive into the health of cows, exploration of ideas related to making and selling of dairy products etc.</p>

									<h3>Healthcare and Sanitation</h3>
									<p>Sanitation and health are fundamental human rights; this idea, however, isn't as widespread as it needs to be. This stream, as part of Sahyog, strives to change this. Members of the team work in the area of sanitation, health and hygiene, by initiating and engaging in drives and raising awareness to improve the state of healthcare and level of sanitation in the villages. Amongst its other achievements, the team has lab-tested water samples from local water sources, installed water purifiers, and filled as well as maintained a database of health cards tracking the health of each and every villager on a quarterly basis. Furthermore, to introduce the concept of hygiene and good health the team has also engaged children from the local school in Kinsu in activities such as parades through the village and poster making. The stream hopes to raise awareness and inculcate right values in children of these two villages so that they develop healthy habits and adopt a healthy attitude from a young age.</p>

									<h3>Education</h3>
									<p>The Education stream spends most of its time interacting with the children of the Government Primary School (Classes I-V) at Kinsu. It aims to teach new concepts, strengthen existing ones, but most significantly, instill a love for learning. Prior to each trip, the stream collaborates with the school's head master and teachers to decide which subject areas to work on, devises plans, and then executes those plans during the trip through various activities. The team also prepares teaching aids that can be used throughout the year to ensure that activity-based learning continues on a regular basis. One important subset of this stream is the ICT stream, which hopes to create an interest for technology in students through exploration of Internet, talks on computing, hands-on activities using various Microsoft programs, and elementary programming.</p>

									<h3>Experiential Learning</h3>
									<p>WWhere education is the fact-based aspect of our society, experiential learning is all that couldn't be contained and confined in a book. Experiential Learning is a term that refers to Sahyog as a whole. We owe to this term all that we owe to Sahyog. At every step of the way, we gain skills and knowledge of our surroundings not by studying but by doing, which includes physical labor/sharm daan and hands-on learning that ends up impacting each individual/participant in a its own way. While residents of Duggada and Kinsu are beneficiaries of and are closely involved in the activities of this stream, the focus is on the experiential learning of the Sahyog volunteers and participants. Although, the entire experience of Sahyog can be categorized as Experiential Learning, the stream undertakes certain tasks specific to it. Among other activities, Sahyog students built the cowsheds (now used for dairy farming), painted school walls, ploughed a field, planted saplings, visited Forest Research Institute in Dehradun. Cooking and sharing a meal with village residents in their homes, and a cultural evening are two perennial features of every itinerary and leave among some of the most cherished memories for many.  </p>
